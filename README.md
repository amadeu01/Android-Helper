## What is that ?
I wanted to try out electron. And also, I wanted something nicer than work with adb though terminal commands.
So, I thought it would be perfect join those two things:
    - Learn Electron
    - Build a simple interface to call adb (Android Bridge) commands

### How to build the app?
Simple run `electron .`
